# BeautyBar
This app is about to provide beauty services.

It will consist of 5 Views:
1. News View with news from developers and some beauty lifehacks/beauty news
2. Services View where users will have to find there services they want 
3. Promotions View
4. Favorites View where users can store on there devices favorite services and workers and access to them without internet
5. Profile View with some settings and Authentication 


WHAT HAVE I DONE:
- Login system with FireBase (big thanks to Stewart Lynch for tutorial videos, it will help a lot with future ideas in this app) also made it customizable to create not only for user account but worker and company account for their employes
- NewsView(custom cells, image downloading func)
- PieceOfNewsView 
- ServicesView
- ServicesSectionView with sorting by categories
- SingleServiceView
- Add to favourite func

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Promotions View [WIP]
- Favorites View (UI part)
- Profile View (delete account func)
* I don't like how NewsView, PieceOfNewsView and ProfileView look like, they need to be changed one day 
** I will make some changes with Tab Bar
*** Also the entire design can be changed :)


FEATURES/BUGS:
1. Slow image downloading system - i will add some sort of async image downloading func 
2. Some problems with ServicesView on small iPhones, easy to fix but found it when published
