# BeautyBar

This app is about to provide beauty services.
It will consist 5 Views:
1. Main View with news from developers and some beauty lifehacks/beauty news
2. Services View where users will have to find there services they want 
3. Promotions View
4. Favorites View where users can store on there devices favorite services and workers and access to them without internet
5. Profile View with some settings and Authentication 


WHAT HAVE I DONE:
- Login system with FireBase (big thanks to Stewart Lynch for tutorial videos, it will help a lot with future ideas in this app)
- Main View (the main part of my idea)

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Main View (custom news Cell and image downloading func)
- Services View (Service cells for different sections, a list of services and connect it to users/companies accounts)
- Promotions View [WIP]
- Favorites View (after Services View)
- Profile View (make it customizable to create not only for user account but worker and company account for their employes)
