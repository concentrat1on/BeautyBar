# BeautyBar
This app is about to provide beauty services.

It will consist of 5 Views:
1. News View with news from developers and some beauty lifehacks/beauty news
2. Services View where users will have to find there services they want 
3. Promotions View
4. Favorites View where users can store on there devices favorite services and workers and access to them without internet
5. Profile View with some settings and Authentication 


WHAT HAVE I DONE:
- Login system with FireBase (big thanks to Stewart Lynch for tutorial videos, it will help a lot with future ideas in this app)
- NewsView(custom cells, image downloading func)
- PieceOfNewsView 

WHAT'S NEXT:
- Services View (Service cells for different sections, a list of services and connect it to users/companies accounts)
- Promotions View [WIP]
- Favorites View (after Services View)
- Profile View (make it customizable to create not only for user account but worker and company account for their employes)
*I don't like how NewsView and PieceOfNewsView look like, they need to be changed one day 


FEATURES/BUGS:
1. Slow image downloading system
